## How it works

NeuroCAM implements a **Content-Addressable Memory (CAM)** optimized for AI pattern recognition tasks. Unlike traditional memory that searches by address, CAM searches by content - making it perfect for template matching, classification, and associative memory applications.

**Core Architecture:**
- **16 stored patterns** Ã— **12 bits each** for optimal tile utilization
- **Parallel Hamming distance calculation** for all patterns simultaneously
- **Priority encoding** to find the best matching pattern
- **Multi-cycle input interface** to handle 12-bit patterns through 8-bit I/O ports

**AI Functionality:**
- **Template Matching**: Compare input patterns against stored templates
- **Nearest Neighbor Classification**: Find closest stored pattern based on Hamming distance
- **Pattern Completion**: Identify stored patterns from partial or noisy inputs
- **Associative Memory**: Content-based retrieval for neural network applications

**Operation Modes:**
1. **Search Mode**: Input a pattern and find the best match from stored patterns
2. **Write Mode**: Store new patterns in the memory array for later matching
3. **Distance Calculation**: Compute Hamming distance between input and all stored patterns

The design uses **fixed-point arithmetic** and **combinational logic** for predictable, deterministic operation - essential for verification and real-time AI applications.

## How to test

**Basic Search Operation:**
1. **Load search pattern** using multi-cycle input:
   - Set `ui_in[1:0] = 00` and provide bits [3:0] via `uio_in[3:0]`
   - Set `ui_in[1:0] = 01` and provide bits [7:4] via `uio_in[3:0]`  
   - Set `ui_in[1:0] = 10` and provide bits [11:8] via `uio_in[3:0]`

2. **Execute search**:
   - Set `ui_in[7] = 1` (search enable)
   - Read results from `uo_out`:
     - `uo_out[3:0]`: Best match address (0-15)
     - `uo_out[6:4]`: Hamming distance (lower 3 bits)
     - `uo_out[7]`: Match valid flag
   - Full Hamming distance available on `uio_out[3:0]`

**Pattern Writing:**
1. **Set write address**: `ui_in[5:2]` (4-bit address for patterns 0-15)
2. **Load write data** using same multi-cycle method as search pattern
3. **Execute write**: Set `ui_in[6] = 1` (write enable) with `ui_in[1:0] = 11`

**Test Patterns for Verification:**
- **Exact matches**: Test with stored default patterns (0x000, 0x0FF, 0xF00, etc.)
- **Hamming distance**: Test with 1-bit, 2-bit differences from stored patterns
- **Boundary cases**: Test with all-zeros, all-ones, alternating patterns
- **Write verification**: Store custom pattern and immediately search for it

**Expected Results:**
- Searching for 0x000 should return address 0 with distance 0
- Searching for 0x001 should return address 0 with distance 1
- Invalid/no-match cases should show appropriate distance values

## External hardware

**No external hardware required** - NeuroCAM is a purely digital design that operates standalone.

**Optional Testing Equipment:**
- **Logic analyzer** or **oscilloscope** for observing multi-cycle input sequences
- **Microcontroller** (Arduino, Raspberry Pi) for automated testing and pattern injection
- **LED indicators** connected to output pins for visual verification of match results

**Recommended Test Setup:**
- Connect input switches to `ui_in` for manual control
- Connect LEDs to `uo_out` to visualize match address and distance
- Use UART interface for automated pattern loading and result logging

**Integration with AI Systems:**
- **UART/SPI interface**: For integration with microcontrollers running AI inference
- **Parallel data buses**: Direct connection to FPGA-based AI accelerators
- **Sensor preprocessing**: Connect to ADCs for real-time pattern recognition from sensors

The design's **8-bit I/O interface** makes it compatible with standard microcontroller ecosystems while the **parallel processing architecture** provides the speed necessary for real-time AI applications.
